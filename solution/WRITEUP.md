# Writeup

The program allows users to create accounts and make transactions between them.

The C code is compiled with Clang [Address Sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html) and [Undefined Behavior Sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html), thus adding tons of runtime checks to catch most undefined behaviors (i.e, bugs). The flags I used to compile the source code are available [here](../Dockerfile#L19).

The program contains lots of bugs, and most of them are caught by the sanitizers, thus making them impossible to exploit! A challenger would probably spend most of its time trying to exploit different bugs, and watch ASAN catch them, with either admiration or frustration ;)

Unfortunately, ASAN isn't perfect, and one bug can be used to exploit the program and get a shell!

Let's see a non-exhaustive list of bugs:

There is also a use-after-free: if you trigger a `realloc()` in `add_account()`, the `Account* src` and `Account* dest` pointers in transaction structures are not updated, and they become dangling pointers. Unfortunately, ASAN is able to catch it!

The only bug that ASAN does not catch correctly is [line 320](../src/cryptobank.c#L320), the variable `index` is controlled by the user, and can produce a heap buffer overflow. This is because ASAN uses "red zones" to catch buffer overflows. ASAN adds a space before and after each memory block, and triggers whenever we read or write on these bytes. By choosing a specific `index`, we can manager to read or write in another block, thus not triggering ASAN. And this is how we bypass ASAN!

The source code is equivalent to:
```
fgets(account->transactions.ptr[index].comment, 30, stdin);
```

With basic math, you can choose `index` so that `account->transactions.ptr[index].comment` points to a valid block.

In [my solution](exploit.py), I chose `index = 10737418244` so `comment = accounts.ptr[2].transactions.ptr`. I can overwrite the `Transaction` structure of the third account.

The `Transaction` structure is:
```
typedef struct {
    Account* src;
    Account* dest;
    char* comment;
    unsigned amount;
} Transaction;
```

We can easily get a **read-write-everywhere** from here. I use this to overwrite the `comment` pointer. To read the `comment`, I ask the program to show me my transactions (with option 1). To write, I ask the program to update the comment of an existing transaction (option 5).

Now, this is classic exploit. Note that ASAN makes addresses deterministic (ie, no PIE). IÂ just leak the GOT, I replace `fgets` by `system`, and then I get a shell!
